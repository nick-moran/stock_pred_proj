# Momentum Trading using Twitter

In this project, we explore momentum trading using twitter. We have cut the repo up into several branches, each representing a part of the project.

They are as follows:
log_reg: in this branch, we explore logistic regression on the twitter data and the news data. We save news data because it performs better.

bert: in this branch, we explore using base bert as a sentiment creator and also using it for keyword detection in a similar manner as the logistic regression

finbert: this is the same as bert, but we use the fin bert model.

twit: this is the branch that we explore using twitter data in. We also built the momentum strategy in this branch, and include several versions of it.
