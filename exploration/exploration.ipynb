       " ('\\nKAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The tweet from President Trump sent shock waves through the market. The president suggesting tariffs of 20 percent on aluminum and 50 percent on steel, just for Turkey, calling relations not good. The informal order coming as tensions between the two countries boiled over, causing a steep drop in Turkey`s currency and a call from Turkey`s president that it would prevail in what he called an economic war, hiking tariffs which Turkey says is illegal and potentially salt in the wound.\\nROBERT HORMATS, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: This does create more problem, and I think that`s what troubles the market so much. It`s not just what`s happened. It`s the fact that the two leaders are now trying to work out something to dampen down the problem. They`re, in fact, taking measures to exacerbate it.\\nTAUSCHE: The company buying steel and aluminum from Turkey are now caught in the middle of the mayhem.\\nFrank Bergren runs Metal Partners International which processes and distributes rebar. We first spoke with him in July as he faced rising bills from tariffs on European partners.\\nFRANK BERGREN, METAL PARTNERS INTERNATIONAL CEO: I would buy all my steel from domestic mills if I had the option. The reality is, is that the capacity isn`t the place to need it.\\nTAUSCHE: Today, Bergren has cargo from Turkey on its way to Houston. He says his Turkish supplier is in an array of panic at the moment. Neither side sure what that steel will cost when it gets there or what this escalation means for future business.\\nFor NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\nGRIFFETH: As we mentioned, the drama in Turkey rattled investors here in the U.S. today. Adding to those jitters, inflation. Consumer prices rose slightly last month, but the 12-month core reading rose nearly 2.5 percent. That was the most we`ve seen in nearly a decade.\\nStocks did come off their low, but it was still a Friday solidly in the red. The Dow was down 196 points when the bell rang at 25,313. The Nasdaq fell by 52, snapping its eight-day win streak, and the S&P was off by 20. For the week, the Nasdaq was the only positive index.\\nSeema Mody has more on today`s action.\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\nSEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Financial affairs swirling around Turkey shook up global markets today after the Turkish lira plummeted 20 percent to a record low against the U.S. dollar. Financials lag on the session, banking stocks like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and J.P. Morgan took a hit on fears that Turkey`s financial crisis could spill over into the global banking space. Bond yields also tumbled to session lows as investors poured money into treasuries in a flight to safety play, and gold prices got a bit, but ended lower on the week.\\nThe big question on the trading floor is what international risks mean for Fed policy. Today`s latest read on inflation looks like it would put the Fed on course to continue raising rates. But that would push the dollar even higher against the Turkish lira, further exacerbating Turkey`s financial woes.\\nPresident Donald Trump added fuel to the fire, announcing he would double Turkey`s metal tariffs as the lira remains in a free fall. Industrial stocks took a hit on that news. Remember, manufacturing giants like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) are often seen as classic proxies for trade war concerns.\\nFor NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Seema Mody at the New York Stock Exchange.\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\nHERERA: Let`s turn now to Art Hogan for more on Turkey and why we should care about what`s happening in that part of the world. He is chief market strategist at F — B. Riley FBR.\\nGood to see you again, Art. Welcome back.\\nART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, B. RILEY FBR: Thanks, Sue. Great to see you.\\nHERERA: It`s good to see you.\\nLet`s talk about strategically how important Turkey is and there are those who think that this maybe the beginning of a more of a global trade war, including China and maybe Russia.\\nHOGAN: Yes. Unfortunately, the global trade war, or the trade tensions that we`re having right now doesn`t seem to be going away any time soon and this doesn`t help that.\\nSo, to put this in perspective, first and foremost, it`s a Friday in the summertime, so the market`s reaction to any news on the macro is going to be larger. We`ve ended the reaction to the micro which is earnings, and we`ve put a lot of the macro concerns behind us, but you can feel that switch over today. You get some news out of Turkey, it escalates and the market pays attention to it in the low-volume Friday.\\nI think the second thing, in terms of trade, it feels like there are spots that are getting better like North America, Mexico and Canada in the Eurozone in particular where we have escalated things. But China for sure hasn`t seen de-escalation and I think that`s the biggest headwind for the market right now is trade tensions and how bad they can get.\\nGRIFFETH: And the strengthening dollar. You know, when you talk so much about how they`re trying to improve things for multinationals here in this country when it comes to trade, but it doesn`t help when the dollar continues to strengthen, right?\\nHOGAN: No, it sure doesn`t, Bill. And clearly that goes hand in glove. Both our monetary policy and our trade policy clearly strengthening the U.S. dollar and that adversely affects emerging markets and clearly, Turkey is the poster child for who gets hurt with the stronger dollar.\\nBut all emerging markets do, and, unfortunately, that`s the offshoot of this. So, until we get to some point where there`s an exit ramp on the trade war highway and start to get to the negotiations and see an easing and strength of the dollar, we`re going to see more situations where that strong dollar is adversely affecting emerging market countries and Turkey just seems to be the one that`s in the hot spot right now.\\nHERERA: The European banks which some have quite a bit of exposure to Turkey, when will we know whether or not they`ll be hurt by this situation here?\\nHOGAN: Yes. I think you will know pretty quick and I would offer up that we would probably hear from the three largest of those banks and they`re in Italy, they`re in Spain and they`re in France and you know — so clearly, those are the three large banks that had the most exposure and we`ll probably get a statement out of them in terms of where they stand right now, what their overall exposure is because their equities are starting to get hit. You know, we know exactly where the players lie and I think that that`s going to be next week`s business where they say, here`s our net exposure and that probably doesn`t help them.\\nGRIFFETH: Quickly, Art, before we let you go. You know, the Fed has made it clear they would like to raise rates two more times before the end of this year. Do you think they might be rethinking that given what`s going on right now?\\nHOGAN: That`s such a great question. You know, the Fed so far and Jay Powell have certainly been ignoring a lot of the global events, and clearly ignoring a flattening yield curve and plotting along, and leading against a strong economy, trying to normalize rates.\\nI`m not sure that there`s going to be enough to get them to blink and perhaps only go one more time this year. But that`s the question we heard all day long.\\nHERERA: Art Hogan, as always. Thank you.\\nArt is with B. Riley FBR.\\nBill?\\nGRIFFETH: Oil prices, by the way, continue their slide, posting a six- straight weekly decline. That market`s worst week in three years, by the way. Today, domestic crude was able to rise 1 percent to settle above $67 a barrel, but the fear is that trade disputes could slow growth and therefore dampen demand for oil.\\nBut as Jackie DeAngelis tells us now, there is a lot more that people are watching in the oil patch.\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\nJACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: With the national average for a gallon of regular gasoline at $2.87 just under that $3 mark, oil prices continue to be on everyone`s mind — global producers, consumers and the president. The International Energy Agency issued its monthly report today, saying the markets are calm, but that could change.\\nIran is in focus now as a second round of sanctions will be put in place in November. That could remove as much as a million barrels a day, a supply offline and maybe more. If that were to happen, prices would go up, but it`s unclear how U.S. allies and purchasers of Iran`s oil will respond to the sanctions, and that`s why analysts believe Saudi Arabia has been cautious about adding barrels back online.\\nToday, the IEA said OPEC`s outlook which flatten July even when the cartel said in June it would add supply to make up for Iran.\\nWhat we know right now is that the glut that the market was worried about has slowly worked itself out. Supply and demand are more balanced that in a tight market, prices can move quickly, so a clear picture should emerge in about three months time.\\nBut for now, prices can dip as the summer driving season comes to a close.\\nFor NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Jackie DeAngelis.\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\nHERERA: It is time to take a look at some of today`s upgrades and downgrades.\\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is getting its second big downgrade of the week. This time, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) taking it from neutral to sell. The firm cites manufacturing issues which it says could hamper Intel`s ability to sustain margins and grow earnings. The price target was cut from $53 to $44 a share. Today`s shares closed at $48.85, down 2.5 percent.\\nOppenheimer thinks the trade fight with China could hit Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) and the firm is downgrading the jeweler from outperform to perform. The analyst still likes Tiffany`s long-term prospect, but is concerned about short-term currency fluctuations, particularly a devaluation of the Yuan, which could impact the buying power of Chinese tourists here in the U.S. The price target was kept at $145. Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) finished at $134.34, down 2 percent today.\\nGRIFFETH: J.P. Morgan is downgrading shares of Campbell`s Soup from neutral to underweight. The analyst there sees a potential sale of the company as an unlikely outcome. You may remember last week a report surfaced saying that Kraft (NYSE:KFT) Heinz had started exploratory talks about buying Campbell`s Soups. Price target there now $36. Campbell closed at $41.35 off more than 2 percent today.\\nAnd SunTrust is initiating coverage of online personal shopping service Stitch Fix. It`s got a buy rating now. The firm says Stitch Fix is the leading pure play in the sector and should continue to outperform expectations. Price target set at $38. In a down day, shares finished at $33.31, up about 5 percent.\\nHERERA: Tesla is reportedly looking for a wide pool of investors to back CEO Elon Musk`s plan to take that automaker private. Bloomberg says the move would help Tesla avoid concentrating ownership among a few large stakeholders.\\nGRIFFETH: Well, Elon Musk has become certainly a celebrity CEO who is closely tied to his company Tesla, just like the late Steve Jobs was to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the beloved Jack Welch to GE. But is it a good thing for investors when the CEO becomes the brand?\\nJ.J. Kinahan is chief strategist at TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD). He joins us now to talk about this.\\nJ.J. KINAHAN, TD AMERITRADE CHIEF STRATEGIST: Hey, Bill.\\nGRIFFETH: Hey, J.J. Welcome.\\nI know you keep a close tab on what your customers buy, you know, month to month and so forth, and often Tesla comes up as one of their top holdings. It`s called betting the jockey, when you want to buy the CEO or the face of the company rather than just the company itself.\\nIs that a good idea or not, do you think?\\nKINAHAN: Well, I don`t think it`s a bad idea. You know, you talk about Steve Jobs right there. Obviously, he as a CEO became sort of the brand to people at some point. The pro — you know, you may start with the CEO attracting you to the product, but then the product itself as long as it`s a good product and people start to become loyal to it, it becomes a very nice circle if you`re that company. You like the CEO. You like the product and you keep being drawn one to the other.\\nSo, there`s nothing wrong with doing that and, of course, as with any investment you don`t want to do it blindly. But if you have a good product, a good CEO who seems to be running things in a very good manner, there is nothing wrong with that. The problem becomes when the CEO sort of goes off the ranch, if you will, that`s when things can get a little bit hairy for investors.\\nHERERA: You know, we purposely pointed out companies outside of the tech arena like a GE, you know. Bill was mentioning earlier when we were talking, you know, Martha Stewart, her brand. She was so closely associated with it.\\nBut is betting the CEO a phenomena that is more common in technology because of the innovation side of things?\\nKINAHAN: I think, Sue, absolutely, it is because — you know, using Mr. Musk as an example, he clearly thinks differently than other people do. He sees opportunity where others may not see it and it`s amazing. You know, you read his biography, you read things that he looks in terms of solar and in terms of space travel, et cetera, he just sees things others don`t. So, that`s amazing and I think people want to bet on the opportunity that he sees because they see opportunity with it.\\nYou know, but one of the things that we have seen in the tech space again, probably more than anywhere else is because there are so many entrepreneurs. Being a great entrepreneur does not necessarily always mean you`re a great CEO.\\nGRIFFETH: Back to Jack Welch before we let you go, there was clearly a Welch premium in General Electric`s stock when he retired and over the last 15 or 18 years or so, it has definitely come out at that point. So, there is something of a danger there, isn`t there?\\nKINAHAN: Absolutely. When you have a CEO so closely associated with the brand, and I will go back to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) example for a second. Tim Cook had not only proved he was a CEO, he had to step in and take the place of a beloved CEO. So, the test track for you is much higher and you have to be the higher standard in order to take the company`s stock price higher. And once you start doing that, all of a sudden, you can become a beloved CEO also.\\nGRIFFETH: J.J. Kinahan with TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD), always good to see you. Thanks.\\nKINAHAN: Great to be here. Thanks, guys.\\nHERERA: Coming up, why the housing market might be in for a rough second half of the year.\\nGRIFFETH: There may be cracks forming in the housing market. Two new reads on the industry are not painting a rosy picture for the remainder of this year. ',\n",
